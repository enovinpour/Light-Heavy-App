        "content": "Pakistan believe they can find a crack in an Australian cricket team which has spent months on the road during a taxing year, while a standoff is brewing between the host nation's past and current players. The touring Pakistan side has arrived in Canberra ahead of a vital Prime Minister's XI clash at Manuka Oval beginning on Wednesday. The Prime Minister's XI have been dealt a blow with Michael Neser ruled out with soreness, opening the door for South Australian Jordan Buckingham to claim a place in the side. Pakistan have won just four Tests on Australian soil in history, but wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed is confident his side can silence its doubters against an Australian team which has won the World Test Championship in London, defended the Ashes in England, and won a one-day World Cup in India throughout the past six months. \"It's not an upset if you're talking about our team,\" Ahmed said. \"We have a very settled team if we're talking about our batting and bowling. We want to play good cricket against a top-quality team, so, Inshallah, hope for the best.\" Pakistan wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed preparing for the Prime Minister's XI clash. Picture by Gary Ramage The Pakistan series looms as a Test farewell for Australian opener David Warner , whose plans for an SCG send-off next month have been lashed by former teammate Mitchell Johnson . The former Australian quick rubbished the idea of Warner being allowed to pick his departure date after his role in the sandpaper scandal five years ago and, more recently, dwindling returns in the Test arena. Johnson's comments have been shot down by Australian chair of selectors George Bailey, who is more concerned with the fitness of Queensland quick Neser in his push to earn a Test recall. \"We're taking a cautious approach with Michael, the elevated risk of potentially another large bowling load in the four-day PM XI's fixture was deemed too high,\" Bailey said. \"We know Michael is a quality player and we have seen him perform in the Test team. We want to ensure that should the opportunity arise to play more Test cricket this summer that we are giving him the best chance to be ready to perform. \"Over the coming days we will work with the Brisbane Heat's medical team to determine his Big Bash League availability.\" Buckingham spent part of the Australian winter in England, playing three games for Northamptonshire, while also suiting up for Australia A against New Zealand A. The 23-year-old has taken 14 wickets in three Shield games for South Australia this summer, including a career best 7-71 against Tasmania in October.

        "content": "Bernard Tomic is no guarantee of an Australian Open qualifying wildcard despite surging over 500 places up the rankings in comeback bid Has had strained relationship with Tennis Australia TA boss says that won't impact whether he gets a wildcard Is not ranked high enough to enter qualifying directly By Ed Bourke For Nca Newswire Published: 22:41 EST, 3 December 2023 | Updated: 22:41 EST, 3 December 2023 e-mail View comments Australian Open boss Craig Tiley has refused to guarantee a wildcard for controversial former star Bernard Tomic as he stands to miss out on the qualifying draw despite a rapid rankings ride. Whether fellow outspoken Australian Nick Kyrgios will take the court in January also remains uncertain, but Tiley said it was still too early to rule out a comeback from a debilitating knee injury. Tomic, 31, has quietly pushed up the world rankings over the last 18 months to reach No.278 after slipping as far as 825 last year. The former Australian and US Open juniors champion has stuck to the Challenger circuit throughout 2023 and reached the quarter-finals of the Brasilia Challenger last week. But he has only played in the main draw of the Australian Open twice since 2018, the last time in 2021, having played nine in a row from his debut in 2009. Tomic has been toiling on the Challenger circuit and has soared over 500 places up the rankings in the last 18 months Despite Tomic's commitment and improvement, Tennis Australia boss Craig Tilley is not guaranteeing him a wildcard for Australian Open qualification Nick Kyrgios is also in doubt for the Australian Open after playing just one single professional match in 2023 Tomic's relationship with Tennis Australia has been strained for years, but Tiley said that would have no bearing on whether he was issued a wildcard for Open qualifying. 'It's not so much about the relationship, but it's about if they're deserving,' Tiley said. 'The things we consider - the form of the player coming in, there is a factor looking at age in some instances because do you want to give a younger player the opportunity versus one who's been the journeyman for a while? 'We haven't made the (wildcard) decisions in qualifying yet ... we've made quite a few decisions on the main draw which we'll announce in the coming days.' Tiley said Kyrgios' availability for the grand slam was still a 'day by day' proposition as he recovered from a knee injury that limited him to a single professional match in 2023. 'As I've said, we're going to have Nick here in some form or another in January ... hopefully it is to play because he's a crowd-pleaser. We love watching Nick and we love having him around,' Tiley said. 'It's hard for me to predict (if he'll play) ... but it's always likely someone is going to be ready to play because they want to play at the Australian Open.' Despite the doubt over Kyrgios' fitness on the local front, Tiley said the return of stars including Rafael Nadal, world No.1 Carlos Alacaraz and a significant contingent of Chinese players had helped ticket sales increase by more than 10 per cent compared with this time last year. The additional day's play is expected to tip attendance over the tournament record.

On Sunday, the West Australian tearaway was named in the 14-man squad for the first Test against Pakistan in Perth from December 14. Australia is confident its \"big three\" quicks Mitch Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will be fit for the match, having each enjoyed almost a month off between the ODI World Cup final and the first Test. That is likely to deny Morris, nicknamed \"The Wild Thing\" for his explosive pace, a fairytale home Test debut. But with four more Tests before the end of January, he and fellow quick Scott Boland have a chance to feature at some point. \"(I've got) itchy feet, but in a good way,\" Morris said. \"I'm excited to ideally get out there and have a crack. \"At this stage, I think my role in the team is being there in case someone does go down, and I'm just hoping to take that opportunity if it does arise.\" Morris' latest inclusion comes almost exactly 12 months after he earned a surprise call-up as injury cover for the second Test of the last home summer. He maintained his spot in the Test squad for the tour of India, but did not have a chance to debut. \"They were two huge learning curves for me,\" Morris said of his first two call-ups. \"I had a great time working with the likes of (assistant coach) Danny Vettori and obviously Andrew McDonald when I was with the squad. \"I feel like I know my own game a lot better after coming away from the Aussie squad.

He returned to red-ball cricket in mid-October and has taken 11 wickets across three Sheffield Shield matches for Western Australia. \"There's probably a little bit of hesitancy at first,\" Morris said of his return to the game. \"But overall it's been a really structured build-up into returning to full game intensity. I think we've done that really nicely as well and I feel like I'm in a really good place.\" Morris has been heartened to have remained in the Test frame despite a disrupted lead-in to the summer. \"It's awesome. I guess that shows they have a bit of faith and a bit of a plan in place,\" Morris said. \"If they're willing to have me around the squad, I'm absolutely stoked with that.\" Morris's ability to consistently bowl faster than 150kph makes him a conducive replacement for Starc if the left-armer is injured or rested. But chief selector George Bailey has already indicated there would be no issue selecting Morris and Starc in the same XI. \"That's awesome.

It’s a blueprint that could serve the organization well as it looks to restock a rotation that partly got liquidated at the last trade deadline. Luis Severino is already in place on a one-year contract worth $13 million. The higher-impact arms remain on the board. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is expected to fetch upwards of $200 million to depart Japan, isn’t scheduled to begin meeting in person with teams until next week. So the Mets (who are contending with the Yankees , among others, for the stud Japanese right-hander) will likely have to focus elsewhere this week, with the winter meetings underway Monday at the Gaylord Opryland hotel. Twelve months after the Mets departed San Diego with Justin Verlander and Jose Quintana before signing Kodai Senga, starting pitching is again a focal point. A winter meetings primer: The 25-year-old Yamamoto, who was posted by the Orix Buffaloes in November, is coveted among teams searching for a potential ace. Blake Snell also falls into the “ace” category, but would the Mets be willing to surrender a draft pick to sign last season’s NL Cy Young award winner? A sensible left-handed option for the Mets could be Jordan Montgomery, whose stock rose last season with the Cardinals and Rangers. Montgomery was ineligible for the qualifying offer and wouldn’t cost the team that signs him a draft pick. The Mets have also been linked to Japanese left-hander Shota Imanaga, who is expected to be posted this week. Imanaga is projected to get upwards of the five-year, $75 million contract Senga received last winter. If the Mets add a Japanese pitcher, they will likely implement a six-man rotation to provide for extra rest. It would leave the team in need of multiple starters behind Senga, Quintana and Severino (who has spent much of the last two seasons battling injuries), even if the Mets plan to let rotation depth such as Tylor Megill, Jose Butto and Joey Lucchesi battle in camp for a rotation spot. Are the Mets willing to gamble that some combination of Brett Baty and Ronny Mauricio will suffice? Joey Wendle was signed last week to a one-year contract worth $2 million, but the veteran infielder is likely to fill the Luis Guillorme role as a backup at multiple positions. Justin Turner remains available as somebody who could provide right-handed pop and play all infield positions with DH as an option. Willy Adames is entering his walk year with the Brewers — with whom new president of baseball operations David Stearns is extremely familiar after his tenure in the team’s front office — and might be available in a trade. Baty was a disappointment last season, but is still only 24 years old. Mauricio is a pure athlete who needs to find a position with shortstop blocked by Francisco Lindor. Mauricio’s chances to play third base have been limited. A dependable bat might be a necessity given the uncertainty surrounding Starling Marte, who missed the final two months of the season with groin discomfort. Is Marte still a full-time outfielder? A part-time DH? A trade possibility? The Mets still owe Marte $39 million over the next two seasons, but could swallow a chunk of that if it helps them obtain a desired player without surrendering too much from the minor league system. Jorge Soler and Teoscar Hernandez are right-handed power bats on the market that could make sense. Tommy Pham is also available after departing the Mets at the trade deadline and helping the Diamondbacks to the World Series. Korean outfielder Jung Hoo Lee is expected to soon post and could be a fit for the Mets. Imagine the Mets signing Josh Hader and pairing him with Edwin Diaz to give the team an absolutely electric back end of the bullpen. But Hader rejected a qualifying offer and falls into the class of free agent that would cost the Mets a draft pick. David Robertson is another name to watch. The veteran reliever was solid filling in at closer last season with the Mets after Diaz tore the patellar tendon in his right knee during an on-field celebration at the World Baseball Classic. The Mets, under former general manager Billy Eppler, seemed intrigued by the idea of bringing back Robertson this offseason — he was dealt to the Marlins at the trade deadline — but Stearns could have other ideas. Aroldis Chapman, Matt Moore and Hector Neris are among the other intriguing names on the board.",

        "content": "Australian Open boss Craig Tiley has refused to guarantee a wildcard for controversial former star Bernard Tomic as he stands to miss out on the qualifying draw despite a rapid rankings ride. Whether fellow outspoken Australian Nick Kyrgios will take the court in January also remains uncertain, but Tiley said it was still too early to rule out a comeback from a debilitating knee injury. Tomic, 31, has quietly pushed up the world rankings over the last 18 months to reach No. 278 after slipping as far as 825 last year. The former Australian and US Open juniors champion has stuck to the Challenger circuit throughout 2023 and reached the quarter finals of the Brasilia Challenger last week. But he has only played in the main draw of the Australian Open twice since 2018, the last time in 2021, having played nine in a row from his debut in 2009. Tomic’s relationship with Tennis Australia has been strained for years but Tiley said that would have no bearing on whether he was issued a wildcard for Open qualifying. “It’s not so much about the relationship, but it’s about if they’re deserving,” Tiley said. “The things we consider – the form of the player coming in, there is a factor looking at age in some instances because do you want to give a younger player the opportunity versus one who’s been the journeyman for a while. “We haven’t made the (wildcard) decisions in qualifying yet … we’ve made quite a few decisions on the main draw which we’ll announce in the coming days.” Tiley said Kyrgios’ availability for the grand slam was still a “day by day” proposition as he recovers from a knee injury which limited him to a single professional match in 2023. “As I’ve said, we’re going to have Nick here in some form or another in January … hopefully it is to play, because he’s a crowd pleaser, we love watching Nick and we love having him around,” Tiley said. “It’s hard for me to predict (if he’ll play) … but it’s always likely someone is going to be ready to play because they want to play at the Australian Open.” Despite the doubt over Kyrgios’ fitness on the local front, Tiley said the returns stars including Rafael Nadal, world No. 1 Carlos Alacaraz and a significant contingent of Chinese players had helped ticket sales increase by more than 10 per cent compared to this time last year. The additional day’s play is expected to tip attendance over the tournament record.",
